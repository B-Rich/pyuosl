Maximilian Scherr, 2002-

This is the a prototype version of a server emulator for Ultima Online: Shattered Legacy.

Later on I ported and continued this with the Delphi programming language and created a more feature-rich version.
However, the source code for that is neither concise nor pretty and I currently cannot find a Delphi compiler I could use for that task.

Hence, I share this minimal prototype written in python.

For a feature-complete emulator written in Java check out Folke Will's [JPhex](https://code.google.com/p/jphex/).
