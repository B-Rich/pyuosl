Maximilian Scherr, 2002-

This is a prototype server emulator for Ultima Online: Shattered Legacy I wrote over 12 years ago.
I did not know about (and thus did not avoid) race conditions at the time and I am sure the code is riddled with other bad surprises, but it is pretty small and somewhat functional.

Later on I ported and continued this using the Delphi programming language and created a more (but still prototypical) feature-rich version.
However, the source code for that is neither concise nor pretty (of course, neither is the Python version) and I currently cannot find a Delphi compiler I could use for improving its state. Hence, I share this minimal prototype written in Python.

For a feature-complete emulator written in Java check out Folke Will's [JPhex](https://code.google.com/p/jphex/).
